# Core Development Principles

## Code Generation Philosophy
- Analyze existing patterns before creating new ones
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Preserve working functionality unless explicitly asked to change
- Generate minimal code that solves the specific problem
- Match the coding style of surrounding files

## Before Making Changes
1. What patterns exist in similar files?
2. Will this break existing functionality?
3. Is this the smallest change that works?

## Universal Best Practices
- Prefer TypeScript over JavaScript when possible
- Use semantic, descriptive names
- Handle errors explicitly
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
